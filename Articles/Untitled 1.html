Music Picks – Mid September 2023</h1>

<br/>

</p>
<p>I have decided to start writing these out on my site so I can get
more practice with article stuff in html these are going to be
written in libreoffice writer and than exported to my site as html
this series of articles will just be to document music I have enjoyed
since the last article.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<h2 class="western"><font face="Nimbus Sans"><span lang="zh-CN"><a href="https://thetojoyamamoto.bandcamp.com/album/tojo-yamamoto">山本東条
</span></font>(Tojo Yamamoto) – The Mongolian Stomper</a></h2>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Tojo Yamamoto is a post-punk band from Lexington, Kentucky
comprised of a number of well established musicians as of writing
their self titled ep is still in preorder I have been listening to
the only so far out track a lot recently which is called the
mongolian stomper I love the tone of the guitar and bass. I am
looking forward for its full release 
</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://noidearecords.bandcamp.com/album/midwestern-minutes">Defiance,
Ohio - Midwestern Minutes</a></h2>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Defiance, Ohio is a band that I have loved for a long time but I
mainly listened to The Great Depression and mostly wrote off
Midwestern Minutes as not all that good other than Hairpool because I
enjoyed the pink couch session they did playing that song after
recently getting both on vinyl I did a focused listen through of
Midwestern Minutes and it grew on me quite a lot I especially have a
new found apreciation for You Are Loved, Her Majesty’s Midwestern
Islands and Dissimilarity Index.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://bustyandthebass.bandcamp.com/album/eddie">Busty
and the Bass - Eddie</a></h2>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>I saw this band live and they did a phenominal preformance not
were my music taste typically falls but I really liked them live
their album is a bit lower energy than they were live but I think its
really great and I copped their album on vinyl at that concert
because of how impressive their preformance was</p>
